# MEG - Patches and Tweaks

---

As you did with **Viva New Vegas** create new separators for the above categories.

### [NV Compatibility Skeleton](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68776)

A skeleton with compatibility for the latest mods

:::info On the left pane in MO2:

Drag **NV Compatibility Skeleton** installed previously from **Viva New Vegas** below the newly created separator. This mod should be as low as possible in your modlist.

## MEG - Navmesh Compatibility Patch

This is a premade Navmesh Compatibility Patch for Mojave Express. This requires YUP, AWLOP, NVInteriors, New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Re-Remastered, The Living Desert, Uncut Wasteland, Vanilla Enhancements, New Vegas Killer, New Vegas Bounties, Lucky Jim's Cache, Mobile Crate Truck Remastered, Sweets Pain NV, Home and Safehouse Tweaks, Uncut Wasteland - NVInteriors Remastered Patch.

**Installation:**

- **Main Files - [MEG - Navmesh Compatibility Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80444?tab=files)**

:::tip Note:

If you download this then disable **VNV Extended Navmesh Patch** and **YUP Navmesh Overhaul Patch** if you have them from **VNV**.

If you do not have all of the selected mods or plan to add more please create your own navmesh compatibility patch using the guide on this page: **[Improved AI (Navmesh Overhaul Mod)](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81003)**

:::

## MEG - LOD

I highly recommend that you generate your own LOD at this point, particularly if you installed **[New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Re-Remastered](https://mojaveexpressguide.com/docs/MEG%20-%20Locations#new-vegas-landscape-overhaul-re-remastered---)**. You can do so by following this [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html). If you have downloaded Viva New Vegas with Wabbajack you will already have the resources listed on that page and so all you need to do is disable the **FNVLODGen Output** mod you have in **MO2** then follow the linked [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html) from the FNVLODGen section onwards. When it comes to naming your LOD **Output** just call it **MEG - FNVLODGen Output**.

:::tip Note: 

Alternatively you can download pregenerated LOD which I generated with all of the mods in VNV + MEG using vanilla textures. You will still need to download the below mods in and install them in the order presented.

:::

**Installation:**

- **Main Files - [FNVLODGen Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58562?tab=files)**

- **Main Files - [LODadditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61206?tab=files)**

- **Main Files - [TCM's LOD Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/70155?tab=files)**
 
- **Main Files - [More LODs Additions and fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81751?tab=files)**

- **Main FIles - [Wasted LOD - Cliffs of Mojave](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/83316?tab=files)**

- **Optional Files - [MEG - FNVLODGen Output](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80444?tab=files)**

```ini title="To increase LOD Draw Distance add these settings to your falloutcustom.ini:"

[TerrainManager]
; Increases the maximum distance of LOD  
fBlockLoadDistanceLow=100000  
fBlockLoadDistance=250000  

[SpeedTree]
; Makes flora use the full objects instead of LOD, this negates pop-in  
bForceFullLOD=1
