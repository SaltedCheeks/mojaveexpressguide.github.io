# Clothing & Armour Texture Guide

#### A temporary clothing & armour retexture guide

---

This is a temporary clothing & armour texture guide I have made as many have been requesting for one. This will stay up until Salamand3r releases his guide as i'm sure it will be much better. This has only been made with FNV in mind. I do not know how well this will work with TTW. I would recommend installing in the order the mods are listed!


### [NV Armor Clothing Upscale Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79241?tab=description)

This mod upscales the ugly blurry 512 to 1k resolution vanilla textures to a more modern 1k to 2k quality using AI Upscaling and brand new generated normal maps.

**Installation:**

- Main Files - NV Upscale Project 1K 2K (WipV7)

:::tip Note:

Unfortunately there are no good comprehensive clothing retextures. The only real option is upscaled clothing and this is the best option I could find. The quality levels will vary depending on the clothing.
