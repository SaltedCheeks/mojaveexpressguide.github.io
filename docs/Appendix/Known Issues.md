# Known Issues

#### This page will document known issues with mods in the guide and will be frequently updated.

**KARPSOL armours clipping** - These have been fixed as best as possible but its not perfect, weapon based fNearDistance can help with this.

**B42 Bows and KARPSOL:** - If you decide to add B42 Bows to the game, when an npc or yourself has both a bow and a poncho equipped the game will crash. 

**Bullet time highlighting whilst ads with scopes looks weird:** - This is an issue between B42 Optics and JAM's bullet time highlighing. The only way to fix is to either disable JAM's bullet time or B42 Optics.
