# Weapon Texture Guide

#### A temporary weapon retexture guide (Archived)

---

This is an archived weapon texture guide that I had made as many have been requesting for one. This was created before Salamand3r's new texture guide. This has only been made with FNV in mind. I do not know how well this will work with TTW. I would recommend installing in the order the mods are listed!
